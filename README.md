# dotfiles

Most of this is just random oneliner scripts/aliases I put together
to make doing things a bit easier.

The .bashrc file, the only real dotfile in this thing, isn't really mine - 
it's just one I pulled off the Internet and it did the job just fine.
I did make a few adjustments, most notably quick `pacman` commands to 
make package management just that little bit easier.
